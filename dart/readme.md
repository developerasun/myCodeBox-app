# Learning Dart essentials
> Dart is a client-optimized language for developing fast apps on any platform. Its goal is to offer the most productive programming language for multi-platform development, paired with a flexible execution runtime platform for app frameworks.

> The Dart language is type safe; it uses static type checking to ensure that a variable’s value always matches the variable’s static type. Sometimes, this is referred to as sound typing. Although types are mandatory, type annotations are optional because of type inference. The Dart typing system is also flexible, allowing the use of a dynamic type combined with runtime checks, which can be useful during experimentation or for code that needs to be especially dynamic.

> Dart offers sound null safety, meaning that values can’t be null unless you say they can be. With sound null safety, Dart can protect you from null exceptions at runtime through static code analysis. Unlike many other null-safe languages, when Dart determines that a variable is non-nullable, that variable is always non-nullable. If you inspect your running code in the debugger, you’ll see that non-nullability is retained at runtime (hence sound null safety).

## Installation
> As the following instructions show, you can use a package manager to easily install and update a stable channel Dart SDK. Alternatively, you can build the SDK from source, grab a Dart Docker image, or install from any release channel by downloading the SDK as a zip file.

> Note: The Flutter SDK includes the full Dart SDK, and has Dart’s dart command-line interface in its bin folder. Install Flutter [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows)
